<h1>The Best Movies According to Shahil</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Favourite movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>The “3 Idiots” movie teaches us that a certificate is nothing more than a piece of paper. Real education is to acquire knowledge. After graduation, Rancho gives away his certificate to someone else, and with the help of his acquired knowledge, he became a great scientist.</p>
<h3>Uri: The Surgial Strike.</h3>
<p>Uri puts a spotlight on the thankless job they do with passion in their hearts and fire in their bellies. The film is a fitting tribute to the Indian Army conceptually but cinematically, it's not a film without flaws.</p>
<h3>Chhichhore</h3>
<p>This movie shows us that we are not defined by the tags given to us by society. And what matters is what tag you give yourself. Every result doesn't define your journey in life, it's your efforts that you're putting in to get those results, is what counts.</p>
